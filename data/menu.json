        "description": "The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a nationwide program that distributes grants to state, county, and municipal agencies to acquire and rehabilitate lands for recreational purposes. The program began to distribute funds in 1966, and its primary focus has been on urban recreation in the eastern states. By its fiftieth year of operation in 2014, the LWCF had distributed more than 42,000 grants to support more than 29,000 recreation projects, totaling more than four million dollars and covering three million acres. A significant portion went to western governments to acquire and improve non-federal park lands. This website maps grants awarded since 1970.",
        "full_description": "Unlike the other natural resource revenue sharing programs mapped by Follow the Money, the Land and Water Conservation Fund operates as a granting program, and distribution involves a many moving parts and significant political input. LWCF grants require counties and municipalities to apply for funding by enumerating specific projects and budgets. Federal approval is done in consultation with congressional legislators from the state, and the state must provide matching funds to qualify for consideration. <br />Another distinguishing feature is the program’s recreational roots. The legislative history of the LWCF stretched over three administrations. Discussions began in 1956 with an investigation commissioned by President Dwight Eisenhower, and in 1958 with the congressionally mandated Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission. The ORRRC report, submitted to President John Kennedy in 1962, called for the creation of a permanent fund that would enable federal, state, and local governments to acquire and rehabilitate lands for recreational purposes. Final passage came in 1964 when Lyndon Johnson signed the somewhat confusingly titled “Land and Water Conservation Fund of 1965” on the same day as the Wilderness Act. The LWCF was in effect an urban counterpart to protecting rural wildlands. <br />The LWCF Act did create a permanent trust fund supplied by fees and gas taxes, but it mandated that most grants go for land acquisition and recreational projects in the eastern United States. Acquisition and restoration projects in the public lands states were always a lower priority, but western projects were in all other respects similar. They have focused on urban and suburban landscapes and on ecological rehabilitation and recreational development. The main political concern with the program in its earliest years was the funding mechanism. Congress worried that the LWCF would create inflationary pressures on user fees and gas taxes, so in 1968 it shifted to appropriating a portion of the annual royalties from offshore oil drilling. This was a popular substitute, and it remains the source of revenues. <br />Over time several agencies have administered the LWCF. In the early years the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation—another product of the 1962 ORRRC report—oversaw the granting program. In 1978 authority shifted briefly to the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service within the Bureau of Land Management, but in 1981 the National Park Service took over the program and has stewarded ever since. Congress is still the fiscal gatekeeper, however. As with the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, the LCWF depends on an annual appropriation, and just like the broader history of fiscal politics at local, state, and national levels, legislative willingness to sustain these environmental grants has waxed and waned since the early 1980s.",

        "description": "When Congress “revested” sovereignty over 2.9 million acres of Oregon & California Railroad Grant lands in 1916, it created a unique federal forest landscape and a unique set of political and fiscal problems. The O&C lands were put under the authority of the Department of the Interior, not the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture, and the government was bound to pay both the railroad holding company for its patented lands and eighteen counties in western Oregon for back taxes on those lands. The next two decades were a litany of failed promises to those counties, so in 1937 Congress passed Public Law 75-405, commonly known as the O&C Act. The O&C Act mandated sustainable yield harvests and established a revenue-sharing formula that finally repaid the counties and then returned 75 percent of all future receipts to the counties. Federal transfer payments flowed into the eighteen counties for the next half century, but the disruption of western Oregon’s lumber industry in the 1980s and 1990s by industrial, ecological, and political changes forced Congress and the counties to experiment with new compensation policies, none of which have worked very well.",
        "full_description": "In 1866, Congress passed the Oregon & California Railroad Act, granting 6 million acres of checkerboarded land to two companies charged with building a road from Portland, Oregon to Marysville, California. The grant was the seventh largest of twenty-two railroad grants awarded in the nineteenth century. In 1869, however, Congress added a unique proviso restricting the O&C Railroad to selling parcels of 160 or less acres to “actual settlers” for no more than $2.50 per acre. The company violated all these terms for decades, so in the early 1900s state and federal officials sued the company, by then the Southern Pacific Company. In 1915 the Supreme Court declared the lands forfeited and instructed Congress to address the issue. The following year Congress passed the Chamberlain-Ferris Act, “revesting” to the federal government 2.9 million acres of the original railroad grant. Three years later in 1919 Congress reclaimed another 93,000 acres from another road grant in western Oregon known as the Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) grant.<br /><br />The O&C lands hold a unique status in the history of Progressive-Era conservation. Unlike the timber, mineral, and hydroelectric sites that presidents withdrew from settlement in the 1890s and 1900s, most of the O&C lands had already been privately patented. Thus the revestment process took 2.9 million acres off local tax rolls, affecting the development policies of many small counties in western Oregon as well as two port districts. To clear the title to those lands, the federal government paid the Southern Pacific Company $2.50 per acre for all reclaimed lands and it promised to use timber receipts to cover back taxes owed to the affected eighteen counties.<br /><br />Actual payments to the counties were a long time coming. The Agriculture and Interior Departments battled over which department would control the O&C lands, foresters withheld trees from the market to leaven private timber values, competitive bids for those trees were rare, and officials thwarted legitimate homesteaders. By 1926 no back taxes had been paid. Congress responded in the late 1920s by passing two laws designed to expedite timber sales and payments, but then logging collapsed with the Great Depression. By 1931 there was a $9 million deficit in the O&C fund, counties were could not support local social services, and local port authority bonds failed in part due to the scant tax base.<br />Neither the railroad nor the federal government had acted in good faith toward O&C counties, so in 1937 Congress passed new legislation regarding the county payments. The O&C Act instituted a sustainable-yield harvests on the O&C and CBWR lands and to bolster the county repayment and programs. This time the exhaustion of private forests and surging demand related to World War II enabled the Interior Department to generate revenues to pay the pre-1915 taxes by 1943 and the 1920s promises by 1951. By 1954 the revenue-sharing formula was funneling 75 percent of timber, grazing, and land sale receipts to the counties for schools and roads.<br />For the next half century O&C payments bolstered the budgets of eighteen counties in western Oregon, but that flow depended on sustained cutting in federal forests. The vulnerabilities in this system were bared by the timber economy downturn in the 1990s, brought on by a combination of mill retooling for smaller logs, a resurgent private lumber sector, and environmentalist concerns over shrinking old growth stands and endangered spotted owls (Strix occidentalis). Rural unemployment skyrocketed while funding for local social services plummeted. Congress responded in 1993 (PL 103-66) with a patchwork program dubbed “Owl Payments” that evolved into the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 2000 (SRS). The O&C revenue sharing formula remained on the books, however, and in 2014 it began to pump revenues into the 18 counties again when Congress failed to renew SRS.",

        "description": "Administered by the Department of the Interior since it began in 1977, the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program (PL 94-565) has distributed more than $7.1 billion to state, county, and local governments in the United States. The intent of PILT is to compensate local governments for federal properties exempted from taxation and that are not otherwise covered by revenue-sharing programs such as those documented on the Follow the Money website. In the American West, with its vast federal inholdings, PILT has operated as a fiscal balancing wheel for lands not used by natural resource industries. During its nearly forty years of operation, PILT has thus become ever more important as a source of revenue as ecological protections and recreational activities have restricted natural resource industries.",
        "full_description": "There are many in-lieu programs that compensate municipal, county, and state governments for taxes lost to government or non-profit holdings, but the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act (PL 94-565) is the only nationwide program which offsets local and county governments for taxes due to federal withholdings. Although the history of in-lieu programs mostly centers on the vast public domain in the American West, there have always been significant amounts of federal property scattered around the country at the local level. With the establishment in 1920 of a congressional principle of compensating western states and counties for tax revenues lost to the public domain, there was growing political pressure in other parts of the country for a program that would address this issue on a more comprehensive basis. Passage, though, waited until the mid-1970s when it became coupled with passage of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (PL 94-579), which permanently closed the public domain to homesteading and other land distribution programs. PILT was thus Congress’s acknowledgement that many counties faced similar fiscal challenges in funding social services, and it was designed to provide a permanent and comprehensive response to taxes lost to federal lands.<br /><br />What gets compensated, and at what rate, is a complicated subject. A key stipulation of PILT is that it provides payments only for lands that do not otherwise produce revenue via the sort of natural resource sharing programs documented on the Follow the Money site. The basic payment formula considers several contingencies. Each county is crediting the acreage of eligible federal land within it, but the rate of payment is adjusted to reflect the population (capped at 50,000) and any revenues derived from other federal natural resource programs are subtracted from the total payout. In theory populous counties with large natural resource payments could end up with no PILT contribution, but this is not the case. Even when the county population or revenues exceed PILT limits, it still receives a minimum rate (in 2012 it was $.34 per acre). There are also a number of quirks to the formula. Some federal spaces are exempted, including Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of Energy, post office, federal building, and base lands, and natural resource payments are not deducted from a county’s PILT entitlement if it has “pass-through” laws that channel funds directly to schools or municipal governments.<br /><br />Political support has been another complicating factor in the payment program. The program’s first fifteen years coincided with high inflation that rapidly eroded the fiscal impact of PILT payments. In 1994 Congress added a cost of living adjustment to offset the diminished payments, but then a new problem emerged. The formula calculates each county’s entitlement, but Congress must appropriate sufficient funds, and when the earmarked support has fallen short, then the payments have been prorated. From 1995 to 2007, an era dominated by Republican control, the PILT appropriation was always less than each year’s calculated amount. The return of Democratic control in Congress brought adjustments. The Emergency Stabilization Act of 2008 (PL 110-343) mandated that appropriations equal the calculated payments, and the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 (PL 112-141) extended this requirement through 2013. Inequities still exist within the formulas, however. Urban counties with large populations still receive PILT payments even though they have broad tax bases, while rural areas still often receive less than the revenues that could be generated from property taxes.",

        "intro_text": "The Secure Rural Schools program (SRS) provided emergency relief for counties due to reduced natural resource activities on federal lands.",
        "description": "In 1993, Congress passed a small payment program to help western Oregon counties that had lost revenue when federal forests were closed to logging due to endangered species listings. By the late 1990s, many more county and municipal governments in the American West and around the country were struggling with similarly fiscal difficulties. Congress responded by turning this patchwork effort into a program that would provide more consistent revenues for schools and roads. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act was an attempt to stabilize a revenue relationship that had faltered due to shifts in the environmental management of federal lands. Unfortunately, Congress’s willingness to fund SRS has been an uneven story, and a program intended to stabilize rural governments itself became an emblem of instability.",
        "full_description": "SRS’s roots lay in the late-1980s timber battles of western Oregon. Logging plummeted as the forests became embroiled in lawsuits to protect habitat for spotted owls (Strix occidentalis), Pacific salmon (Oncorhyncus spp.), and marbled murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus). The fiscal impact on timber counties was severe, so in 1993 Congress extended relief to the eighteen Oregon & California Railroad Lands counties. The ten-year relief was dubbed “owl payments.” These were intended to shrink annually until 2003, but in 2000 Congress instead expanded and extended the program with the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000, which compensated rural counties nationwide for declining transfer payments due to changes in natural resource management on federal lands.<br /><br />SRS had three goals: to stabilize funding to local governments, to diversify employment through infrastructure and ecological rehabilitation projects, and to improve relations between agencies, communities, and interest groups. The first goal was most readily achieved. SRS counties had to choose to continue with the old formula or to adopt one of several new payment plans. By 2003, 615 or 717 eligible counties had opted for SRS payments because they were either greater or more consistent. Over 90 percent of these payments went to California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska.<br /><br />Less clear is the extent to which rural counties and residents benefitted from SRS. The aim was to stabilize rural schools, but actual funding varied by how states apportioned monies between schools and roads and between school systems. Baseline education funding fell sharply in many states due to property tax limits, and equalization formulas further reduced rural shares. Finally, 15 to 20 percent of each SRS payment was earmarked for habitat restoration or other public land infrastructures. Resource advisory boards including outside interests oversaw these projects, and they often sought to decouple governance from resource payments and to diversify local politics and economies. Evidence on how initiatives faired and how SRS benefits circulated is mixed, but advisory committees do seem to have improved community and governmental relationships.<br /><br />SRS was a temporary measure, a bridge to a different future, but how that new fiscal relationship would work remained unclear. Some wanted to wean counties from what they portray as welfare payments; others wanted to develop tax-equivalency formulas, but no view gained much support. As a result each pending termination elicited panic and new expedients. SRS was set to expire in 2006, but a last-minute reprieve gave it another year. Several more legislative extensions failed before Congress passed a new law in late 2008. The revised rules again offered several payment options, and again all were to shrink annually until termination in 2012. Because of the legacy of owl payments, Oregon, California, and Washington instead received “transition payments” from 2008 to 2010, after which fiscal havoc ensued in rural Oregon. In 2011 eleven counties faced budgetary crises, and two nearly went bankrupt. Congress responded with further extensions in 2011, 2012, and 2013.<br /><br />Congress did not extend SRS in 2014, so federal resource agencies reverted to paying counties via the original resource programs, including the 1908 Forest Service 25 percent program, 1920 Federal Mineral Leasing Act, the 1934 Taylor Grazing Act, the 1937 Oregon & California Lands Act, and the 1937 Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenancy Act. Put another way, after a quarter century public lands counties and federal agencies were back to where they had started, but SRS was extended (PL 114-10) two more years in spring 2015.",
